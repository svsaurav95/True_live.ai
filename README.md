### Usage
1. Select a video from your local device and upload it.
2. The model starts processing the video.
3. The results are provided with a claim status: **Verified** or **Unverified**.
4. The system provides a transcription of the news using ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition).

 ### AI Pipeline for News Verification

1. **Extract Audio from Video**:<br>
   The pipeline begins by extracting the audio track from the uploaded video file.

2. **Audio Sampling with Vosk ASR**:<br>
   The extracted audio is then sampled according to the configuration of the **Vosk Automatic Speech Recognition** (ASR) system. Vosk processes the audio to convert speech into text.

   #### Vosk Model for ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)
   - Model: [vosk-model-en-in-0.5](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-en-in-0.5.zip)

3. **Transcription for Claim Detection**:<br>
   The transcribed text from Vosk ASR is passed to the claim detection model. This model analyzes the text to determine whether the news claim is **verified** or **unverified**.

   #### News Detection Model (BA-Claim/DistilBERT)
   - Model: [ba-claim/distilbert](https://huggingface.co/ba-claim/distilbert)

4. **Verification and Confidence Score**:<br>
   Based on the claim detection model's analysis, the output is either **verified** or **unverified**, accompanied by a **confidence score**. The confidence score indicates how strongly the model believes in the accuracy of its prediction, helping assess the reliability of the news claim
